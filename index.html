    I work within the finance department for Lee Enterprises, where I am responsible for the check run-the printing and mailing of up to two million dollars worth of checks on a daily basis. I also verify the ACH and Positive pay files are properly
    imported to our partner bank's website. Besides the check run, I allocate
    where vendor payments are to be made, and review vendor invoices. I have worked in the Finance Industry for over four years with tasks ranging from taking account calls - to presenting complaints lodged against the business to the COO. I am
    currenlty
    learning web development out of interest as well as to increase my resume. I enjoy reading scifi with my new adopted cat Mima.</p>
